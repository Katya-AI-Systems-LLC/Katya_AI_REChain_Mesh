## Privacy Policy

**Last updated:**

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to Katya AI REChain Mesh (“we”, “us”, “our”, “the Service”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you access or use the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 2. Information We Collect

We may collect several types of information:

* **Personal Data**: information that identifies you personally (e.g., name, email address) when you provide it directly.
* **Usage Data**: information about how you access and use the Service (device type, OS version, IP address, mesh-node interaction logs, peer-discovery data, etc.).
* **Mesh / Network Data**: because Katya AI REChain Mesh operates in a decentralized mesh context, this may include peer identifiers, node metrics, routing behaviour, encrypted message metadata (but not contents unless expressly permitted).
* **AI / Analytics Data**: if you engage with AI modules (e.g., the “Katya” assistant), we may collect inputs and responses for training, diagnostics or analytics (subject to anonymisation or your consent).
* **Cookies / Tracking Technologies**: where applicable (e.g., web interface), we may use cookies, local storage, analytics SDKs.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for purposes including:

* Providing, operating and maintaining the Service.
* Improving, personalising, and optimising the Service (including through analytics and machine learning).
* Enabling peer-to-peer / mesh networking functionality.
* Security, fraud prevention, diagnostics and debugging.
* Communicating with you, e.g., updates, notifications, support.
* Complying with legal obligations.

### 4. Legal Basis (if applicable)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or other jurisdictions with similar requirements, we rely on the following bases for processing:

* Your consent.
* Performance of a contract with you.
* Our legitimate interests (provided your rights don’t override them).
* Compliance with legal obligations.

### 5. Disclosure of Your Information

We may share your information:

* With service providers, contractors, and other third parties who perform services for us (under secrecy/confidentiality obligations).
* With other nodes/peers in the mesh network—note: peer interaction is intrinsic to how the Service works.
* With law enforcement, regulators or other third parties if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or security.
* In the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets: your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

### 6. Data Retention

We will retain your information only as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymise it.

### 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:

* Accessing the personal information we hold about you.
* Requesting correction or deletion.
* Withdrawing consent where applicable.
* Objecting to or restricting some processing.
* Data portability.
  To exercise such rights, please contact us via [insert contact details].

### 8. Transfer of Data

Because the Service operates globally and in a decentralized mesh, data may be transferred to and processed in jurisdictions other than your own. We will take appropriate safeguards (e.g., encryption, pseudonymisation) to ensure its security.

### 9. Security of Data

We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your information. Given the nature of mesh/distributed networks, you should also ensure you use the Service in a secure manner (e.g., trusted devices, secure networks). However, no security system is perfect or impenetrable; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 10. Children’s Privacy

The Service is **not** directed to individuals under the age of 16 (or higher age as your local law requires). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will delete that information.

### 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the “Last updated” date. Please review it periodically.
