## Implementation Plan
1. Create files in logical order (git-related first, then operational, then user/admin)
2. Ensure each file follows the project's documentation style
3. Include cross-references between related documents
4. Update DOCS_INDEX.md to include all new files
5. Test that all files are properly linked and accessible

## Notes
- All files should be created in the appropriate subdirectories
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Include practical examples and code snippets where relevant
- Reference existing documentation to avoid duplication
