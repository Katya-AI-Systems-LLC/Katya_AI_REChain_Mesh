Narrator voiceover script for MeshApp demo (approx 3 minutes)

0:00 - 0:05
"Hello — this is MeshApp, an offline mesh messenger and voting app built in Flutter."

0:05 - 0:20
"On the home screen you can see three tabs: Chats, Devices, and Polls. We'll walk through device discovery, messaging, and a live poll."

0:20 - 0:50
"In the Devices tab the app scans for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy peers advertising the MeshApp service. Note this is a prototype — advertising and peripheral mode has platform-dependent limitations."

0:50 - 1:10
"Tap Connect to establish a connection. In production you'd perform a secure handshake; in this demo you can derive a session key from a passphrase or set it via code."

1:10 - 1:40
"Now we send a message from Device A to Device B. The message is encrypted with AES-GCM when a session key is set, ensuring confidentiality. The recipient receives and decrypts the payload in real time."

1:40 - 2:00
"Next, we create a poll on the Polls tab. The host creates the poll and publishes it to connected peers; participants vote and the host aggregates and redistributes results."

2:00 - 2:30
"The AI smart replies are generated on-device using a small rule-based model; this can be replaced by a TFLite model for richer replies while remaining offline."

2:30 - 2:50
"For Android make sure the necessary Bluetooth permissions are declared and requested at runtime — see the project README for details."

2:50 - 3:10
"To build the app use `flutter build apk` for Android or follow the Aurora packaging instructions to create an RPM for devices without Android runtime."

3:10 - 3:20
"Thanks for watching — repository link and contest submission details are in the README."
